# Suricata Placeholder

This directory is reserved for Suricata IDS/IPS configuration (EVE JSON output) and integration notes with Wazuh/SIEM. In production, deploy sensors at the ingress and within the cluster overlay network.

- Enable EVE JSON and forward to SIEM (e.g., Wazuh or OpenSearch).
- Correlate app anomalies with network alerts.
